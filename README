Euler Benchmark Suite

The Euler Benchmark Suite aims at comparing language speeds for the Euler
Project Problems at http://projecteuler.net/.

This currently consists of Perl 5, Rakudo Perl 6 and Parrot solutions, but all languages are
welcome.

Files in each directory are named according to:

<language>/<3-digit project euler number>/<2-digit implementation number>.ext
