/**

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms
will be:

term: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, ...
 val: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

Find the sum of all the even-valued terms in the sequence which do
not exceed four million.
